# Predictive Modeling for Smartphone Market Pricing
This project focuses on Smartphone Price Prediction using a combination of machine learning and data analysis techniques. The goal is to build predictive models that accurately estimate smartphone prices based on various features such as brand, specifications, and market trends.

### Key features:

- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical data to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Modeling: Implemented a variety of machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, comparing their performance.
- Pipeline Integration: Utilized R pipelines (e.g., with caret and tidymodels) to automate the workflow for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training, ensuring efficiency.
- Evaluation: Achieved a high accuracy score with the models, demonstrating robust performance in predicting prices based on smartphone specifications.

The project is a comprehensive exploration of how predictive modeling can be applied to real-world data, showcasing a practical use case for market analysis and price estimation.
